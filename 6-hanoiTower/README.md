# Hanoi Tower

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. The objective is to move a stack of disks from one rod to another, following these rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move involves taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
This repository provides a solution that can handle any number of disks and outputs the steps required to solve the problem.

This repository contains a solution for the Tower of Hanoi problem using 3 rods. The solution is implemented in Python and can solve any possible configuration.
